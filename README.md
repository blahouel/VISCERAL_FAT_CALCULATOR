The Visceral Fat Calculator is a health-focused web application designed to estimate and track visceral fat levels—the "hidden" fat stored deep inside the abdominal cavity around vital organs.

Unlike general Body Mass Index (BMI) which measures total body mass, this app focuses on a more critical marker of long-term health and cardiometabolic risk.

Core Functionality
Anthropometric Estimation: Uses a validated model combining specific body measurements to provide an accurate evaluation of visceral fat depots without the need for expensive medical imaging like CT or MRI scans.

Calculated Metrics:

Age, Weight, and Height: Basic profile data used for baseline calculations.

Waist Circumference: A primary indicator of internal fat deposits coating the heart, liver, and kidneys.

Thigh Circumference: Included as part of the anthropometric model to improve the accuracy of fat distribution assessment.

Result Categorization: Automatically classifies results into levels such as Normal, High, or Very High based on visceral fat area (typically with a threshold of 130 cm² for visceral obesity).

Key Features
Interactive Scale: A visual indicator that maps your visceral fat value on a scale from 1 to 25 to help you visualize where your levels fall.

Personalized Guidance: Based on your result, the app provides tailored health advice:

Normal: Encourages maintaining current healthy habits.

High/Very High: Recommends focusing on aerobic exercise, strength training, and a fiber-rich diet, while suggesting consultation with a healthcare professional.

Measurement Guides: Integrated instructions on how to measure correctly, such as finding the midpoint between the lower rib and hip bone for the waist, or measuring at the gluteal crease for the thigh.

Health Significance
High visceral fat is a "silent threat" associated with significant risks, including Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and chronic inflammation. This app serves as a tool for "wellness-first" tracking, allowing users to see tangible health improvements even when the number on the scale stays the same.
